a simulation
------------
this is expressed as a script?
is the paradigm something like

$ mpirun -np 128 python ./simulation_2B.py

or is it 

$ mpirun -np 128 pydro simulation_2B

where simulation_2B is some kind of input file?

has a number of fields

one timestepper

some physics

some (inline) analysis
