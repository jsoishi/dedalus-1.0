Objects
-------

* Fields
   -- xspace representation
   -- kspace representation
   -- name

* representation

  -- this is the fundamental parallel object: it needs to be aware of
     the processor layout and do multi-dimensional partial FFTs

  -- fftw plan
  -- pointer to data 

   -- subclass: xspace
   -- subclass: kspace

* Physics
  -- this *defines* the necessary fields. 
  -- should therefore have a class factory to build fields
   -- subclass: MHD
   -- subclass: shear
   -- subclass: anelastic

* Init cond

* Analysis

* solvers
  -- derivatives

* timestepper
  -- has an RHS object

* RHS
  -- this is essentially a list of physics objects

a simulation
------------
this is expressed as a script?
is the paradigm something like

$ mpirun -np 128 python ./simulation_2B.py

or is it 

$ mpirun -np 128 pydro simulation_2B

where simulation_2B is some kind of input file?

has a number of fields

one timestepper

some physics

some (inline) analysis
